# These are some suggestions for the project

## Suggestions:
- Use a switch statement for the various operations
- Include more operations like absolute value or square root
- As it is, the calculator can only do one calculation per execution, which can be tedious. Maybe do something like  sub (add 2 2) 3, or 2 + 2 - 3.
- Maybe include memory
